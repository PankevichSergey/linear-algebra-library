Mat class supports basic operations with matrices: concatenation, multiplication, addition, fast raising to a power, gaussian elimination, finding an inverse, a characteristic polynomial, determinant and trace.

Matrices(class Mat) consist of vectors(class Vec) that use Num class which is an implementation of a rational fraction, so any operations inside rational numbers field are done without loss of precision.

Perm class supports permutations product, fast raising to power, finding sign of a permutation and its decomposition into cycles.

 Poly class provides an interface that allows to multiply, add, read, print and compare polynomials.
